Neural Network Regression with TensorFlow
This repository demonstrates the use of a neural network for predicting medical insurance costs using TensorFlow.

Project Overview
The project involves:

Data Exploration: Understanding the structure and distribution of the dataset.
Data Preprocessing: Handling categorical variables, scaling, and splitting the data.
Model Building: Creating and training neural network models.
Model Evaluation: Assessing model performance using Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
Normalization: Applying data normalization techniques to improve performance.
