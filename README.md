# Neural Network Regression with TensorFlow

This repository demonstrates the use of a neural network for predicting medical insurance costs using TensorFlow.

## Project Overview

The project involves:
1. **Data Exploration**: Understanding the structure and distribution of the dataset.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Handling categorical variables, scaling, and splitting the data.
3. **Model Building**: Creating and training neural network models.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
5. **Normalization**: Applying data normalization techniques to improve performance.
